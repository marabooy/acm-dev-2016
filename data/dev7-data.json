        "abstract": "In recent times, migrating from touch-based input devices to touchless input devices has become one of the major research problems considering the health hazards exposed in public usages (e.g., information kiosk) of the touch-based devices. The problem still remains mostly open, since a solution having the properties of being low-cost, low power consuming, robust, and easy-to-use, is yet to be proposed in the literature. As a remedy to this situation, in this paper, we propose a visible light based touchless input device (named Sporshohin), retaining all the properties mentioned above, for ensuring ubiquitous usage. Sporshohin recognizes predefined gestures performed by the user, through an underlying mechanism that exploits well-known reflection model over the visible light spectrum. The underlying mechanism is intelligent enough to guarantee robustness against varying environmental lighting conditions and undefined noisy gestures. Real implementation, involving interaction with diversified users, confirms high accuracy and usability along with existence of all the above mentioned properties. We show the emulation of Sporshohin as an input interface for an information kiosk. The attributes of Sporshohin exhibit its prospect of being used in diversified applications going beyond information kiosks.",

        "abstract": "People with visual impairment use Braille as a medium of textual representation having palpable dots. While the more privileged among us use OCR based text readers as preferential alternative, the lesser privileged ones are still bundling with conventional Braille tools. Our endeavor in this paper is to develop a low-cost and easy-to-use solution for less privileged people. Here, we propose EyePen, a system that enables less privileged visually-impaired people reading Braille characters, printed using conventional ink-jet and laser printers. The use of printed Braille characters, using ink-jet printers, offers a cost-effective alternative in place of the more expensively printed conventional palpable Braille dots. Besides, EyePen demands a very short learning period and offers a smooth learning experience ensuring ease-of-use while being in operation. We perform user evaluation over our developed system to confirm these findings. The user evaluation results show that the accuracy of reading printed Braille characters using EyePen converges to 100% within a very short period of time for all users. Finally, we present a potential writing aid that can facilitate low-cost and easy writing of Braille characters on normal paper exploiting our system.",

        "abstract": "We can accurately detect mosquito species with 80% accuracy using frequency spectrum analysis of insect wing-beat patterns when mapped to low-power embedded\/IoT hard- ware. We combine energy-efficient hardware acceleration optimizations with algorithmic tuning of signal processing and machine-learning routines to deliver a platform for in- sect classification. The use of low power accelerator blocks in cheap embedded boards such as the Raspberry Pi 3 and Intel Edison, along with performance tuning of the soft- ware implementations enable a competitive implementation of mosquito classification task on standard datasets. Our approach demonstrates a concrete application of embedding intelligence in edge devices for reducing system-level energy needs instead of simply uploading sensory data directly to the cloud for post-processing. For the mosquito classification task, we are able to deliver classification accuracies as high as 80% with Intel Edison processing times as low as 5 ms per sample and an energy use of 5 mJ per sample (2 months of continuous non-stop use on an AA battery with 2000 mAh capacity or longer depending on insect activity). We envision a network of connected sensors and embedded\/IoT platforms deployed in vulnerable areas such as construction sites, mines, areas of known mosquito activity, ponds, river- fronts, or other areas with standing water bodies. In our experiments, targeting a 20% loss rate, we observed the ad-hoc WiFi range for mesh networks using the Raspberry Pi 3 boards to be 14m while the Photon board connecting to WiFi router nodes can stretch this to 35 m.",

        "abstract": "Digital money drives modern economies, and the global adoption of mobile phones has enabled a wide range of digital financial services in the developing world. Where there is money, there must be security, yet prior work on mobile money has identified discouraging vulnerabilities in the current ecosystem. We begin by arguing that the situation is not as dire as it may seem---many reported issues can be resolved by security best practices and updated mobile software. To support this argument, we diagnose the problems from two directions: (1) a large-scale analysis of existing financial service products and (2) a series of interviews with 7 developers and designers in Africa and South America. We frame this assessment within a novel, systematic threat model. In our large-scale analysis, we evaluate 197 Android apps  and take a deeper look at 71 products to assess specific organizational practices. We conclude that although attack vectors are present in many apps, service providers are generally making intentional, security-conscious decisions. The developer interviews support these findings,  as most participants demonstrated technical competency and experience, and all worked within established organizations with regimented code review processes and dedicated security teams.",

Such systems implement various motivational strategies to promote ongoing use. Existing initiatives to design such systems focus on engaging only the beneficiary of information derived from those systems. In this study, we explored how one can use gamification to motivate ongoing usage of such systems in the context of intermediated technology use. We studied the effect of gamification in motivating young family members to assist adults who might be less conversant or intimidated with such a technology. We compared two designs of a mobile wellness application of which one prototype is gamified and the other one is not gamified. Our findings suggest that virtual rewards can enhance usage of such systems through intermediary users. We highlight some of the design implications in order to foster perceived enjoyment in using such a system.",

        "abstract": "High-resolution population density maps are a critical component for global development efforts, including service delivery, resource allocation, and disaster response. Traditional population density efforts are predominantly survey driven, which are laborious, prohibitively expensive, infrequently updated, and often inaccurate -- especially in remote areas. Furthermore, these maps are developed on a regional-basis where the methods used vary region to region, hence introducing notable spatio-temporal heterogeneity and bias. \r\n\r\nThe advent of global-scale satellite imagery provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to create inexpensive, accurate, homogeneous, and rapidly updated population maps. To fulfill this vision, we must overcome both infrastructure and methodological obstacles. We propose a convolutional neural network approach that addresses some of the methodological challenges, while employing a publicly available, albeit low resolution, remote sensed product. The method converts satellite images into population density estimates. To explore both the accuracy and generalizability of our approach, we train our neural network on Tanzanian imagery and test the model on Kenyan data. We show that our method is able to generalize to unseen data and we improve upon the current state of the art by 177 percent.",

We implemented a mobile asynchronous-voice platform, through which Community Health Workers (CHWs) in rural Lesotho report previously unknown health challenges and knowledge gaps to the nurses, who then create new digital content and redesign service delivery to address these challenges. Beyond this, we also used role-play both as an additional feedback channel and a design tool. Our results demonstrate the combined benefits of implementing creative methods for effective human-to-technology and human-to-human communication in ways that enable new forms of expression; and highlight the importance of using role play in HCI4D contexts.

        "abstract": "Cutting edge communication technologies such as smartphones remain far from prevalent in most of the settings with the greatest need for improved health and development programs. As a result, designers of ICT4D initiatives often weigh difficult tradeoffs between the usability of smartphone applications for structured data collection versus the battery life, durability, cost and familiarity of basic phones. However, as this paper and our deployment experiences demonstrate, such tradeoffs are not entirely necessary. Most mobile network operators in sub-Saharan Africa offer value added services via simple, menu-driven applications that run directly from the SIM card. While conventional SIM applications can only be accessed by mobile network operators, this paper describes the design and implementation of a ‘thin SIM’ approach that does not require mobile network operator involvement. We have implemented this tool with more than 3,000 health workers and describe particular deployment experiences in Kenya, Benin, Nepal and Guatemala. We then reflect on a number of important limitations of the thin SIM approach, and opportunities for further development and deployment. Ultimately, we argue that there is an important role for SIM applications as one part of a configurable data collection toolkit for supporting global health and development programs.",

        "abstract": "Many banking and commerce payment systems in developing regions require users to share private or sensitive information in clear-text with untrusted providers exposing them to different forms of MitM attacks. In this paper, we introduce Alphacodes, a new paradigm that enables users to secure transactions with untrusted parties using the notion of human-computable visual puzzles. We describe how Alphacodes can be applied in different use cases and also show two simple applications that we have built using the Alphacodes framework. We motivate our solution using security vulnerabilities in existing systems, and show how our protocol overcomes them. We also demonstrate the ease of use of Alphacodes with minimal training using two simple crowdsourcing studies. Using another simple real world user study involving 10 users who speak Kannada (a regional Indian language), we show that the Alphacodes concept can be easily extended to other languages beyond English.",

The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools such as Immunization Information Systems (IIS) to improve efficiency of vaccination programs has shown mixed but encouraging results in terms of success. The objective of this paper is to present evidence of Evaccs – a successfully deployed smartphone based vaccinator monitoring app, discuss the need to create a smartphone enabled IIS (called Har Zindagi – every life matters) that can store digital records of every child, discuss various design and implementation features of Har Zindagi’s android application, and present findings of the usability testing performed on the Har Zindagi android app. Given that the vaccinators are non tech-savvy, and the real estate on a smartphone is limited, this application was particularly designed to allow easy record entry process, and smoothen the workflow. This paper builds upon previous work on user interface design for low-literate users, and identifies techniques to iteratively design interfaces with government employees, who may be uncomfortable with giving usability feedback due to fear of repercussions or might have different field reality when compared to their supervisors and policy makers.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a study of mobile data usage in South African townships. In contrast to previous studies, which have studied mobile data usage in developing regions (including South Africa), we focus our study on two townships in South Africa; the extremely resource-constrained nature of townships sheds light, for the first time, on how people in these communities use mobile data. We perform a mixed-methods study, combining quantitative\r\nnetwork measurements of mobile app usage with qualitative survey data to gain insights about mobile data usage patterns and the underlying reasons for user behavior concerning mobile data usage. Due to the limited availability of public free Wi-Fi and despite the relatively high cost of mobile data, we find that a typical township user's median mobile data usage is significantly more than Wi-Fi usage. As expected, and consistent with observations of mobile data usage in parts of South Africa with better resources, users tend to favor using Wi-Fi for streaming video applications, such as YouTube. Interestingly, however, unlike users in less resource-constrained settings, township users also consume significant mobile data to update mobile applications, as opposed to relying on Wi-Fi networks for application updates. These behaviors suggest that network and mobile application designers must pay more attention to data usage patterns on cellular networks to provide mobile network architectures that provide more cost-effective mechanisms for tasks such as application update.",

The Medea system has been developed to support data collection on mobile devices, while addressing issues of manageability and security in healthcare data collection and delivery.  The Medea approach is based on a compiler (Aeetes) that generates new data collection apps from declarative specifications, a security architecture to protect the confidentiality of patient data in case of device compromise, and a supporting app infrastructure that supports deployment in settings without local server support.  Manageability is achieved by centralizing the management of the infrastructure, using remote management of mobile devices to provide IT support to deployments in relatively isolated and under-served locations.",

This paper examines how these two structures can be combined in a claims-to-patterns approach to leverage mobile interaction design for low-literacy. To demonstrate this method, an example that highlights how claims evolve into patterns through research and design is discussed.",
