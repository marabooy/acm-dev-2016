        "abstract": "Mobile devices have become ubiquitous, however they often do not equate with access to communication services. Indeed, many of the 60 million people forcibly displaced worldwide who have access to mobile devices, lack communication services due to lack of infrastructure or lack of Internet credits. In this research-in-progress, we provide the basis to create cloudless co-located social media on Android. To do so, we present a novel middleware solution called PadocAndroid, which allows multihop ad hoc communication between off-the-shelf Android devices. We also present experimental results and a proof-of-concept chat application to illustrate the usage of the middleware.",

We report a deployment aimed at employing voice-based, telephone services to conduct automated, structured interviews of low-literate users and to advertise relevant development-related services to them. Survey calls were placed to 67,000 recipients of vocational training to validate their phone numbers and to find out their current job status. Of these, 45,500 answered these calls and 11,500 (25%) responded to the survey questions. Manually conducted follow-up interviews found more than 70% of the survey results to be consistent and also revealed the impact of phone sharing (among family members), call timing, simplicity of interface and surveyor-participant interpretation mismatch regarding certain survey questions on participant involvement and validity of survey results.",

        "abstract": "Protecting user privacy has become an important research problem in recent years. We introduce the first approach for collecting feedback and opinions from workers about the poor workplace condition in a privacy preserving manner and empower them at their workplaces. In our system, a worker's feedback remains hidden in an aggregate form but at the end the actual scenario of the workplace could be revealed. Thus, our system protects workers from facing troubles and losing jobs for sharing their sufferings to the public. On the other hand, the revealed feedback can motivate the management authority to improve the quality of their workplaces in the fear of losing trust and reputation. We propose two techniques: in one technique, workers in cooperation with the server hide their individual feedback from other and in other technique, workers protect their privacy in a crowdsourced manner. We show a comparative analysis of our techniques with experiments.",

So, the air quality inside public transports is an important factor that needs to be considered for the welfare of city residents. In this paper, we study the air quality inside public transports in a metropolitan city from the perspective of a developing country. To capture the diversity of city life, we consider the variation in traffic pattern and public transports, and analyze the data in temporal and spatial domain. Our custom-built sensing module collects data at regular intervals and detects the presence of pollutants above recommendation level. Our temporal analysis shows that concentration of air pollutants inside different public transports do not remain consistent in peak and off-peak hours. Our analysis also reveals that public transports with lower fares are more exposed to air pollutants than those with higher fares.",

Waste management  problem is acute in the cities and urban areas now a days. Number of trucks roaming around, collecting waste at any time, excessive manpower requirement and inefficient monitoring are some of the difficulties we face with the conventional waste collection approach. The purpose of our work is to introduce a smart and intelligent waste management system that is able to handle the process dynamically and cost effectively. In our approach weight and volume of waste thrown in the waste bins are collected by economical sensors and then sent to cloud server using a micro-controller and GPRS. This data is used to find the waste collection schedule to maximize the collection. Location of vehicles and waste bins are used to find the shortest possible collection route for each truck which is implemented by Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) technique. The system is adaptable to dynamic changes i.e. routes blocked during waste collection process. The whole process can be monitored centrally and thus provide a high quality service to the citizens of a smart city.",

Deterministic and proba-bilistic simulators exist to model these microgrids, and each focuses on different technical aspects.  With the addition of smart meters into microgrids, monitoring and control is now available at high granularity, which enriches microgrid planning and operation. This research is designing a new simulator to model smart microgrids with discrete probability distributions as supply and demand inputs. In our model, smart meters allow real-time power clipping for demand side management, effec-tively smoothing the system load curve as needed. To compare clipping schemes for grid operation and generation mixes for planning, we aggregate inputs by convolution then compute expected energy sold and probability of avoiding power cuts. The simulator plots these values for different combinations of power clipping threshold and number of customers clipped.",

        "abstract": "This poster presents an app that can help disaster affected communities in finding efficient and safe evacuation routes to reduce the loss of human and resources, both during and after a disaster hit. This proposed app will navigate people seeking evacuation through suitable routes based on geographical condition, structural vulnerability, disaster severity, traffic density, human mobility, etc. The choice of most effective and safe evacuation paths primarily relies on stochastic probability and requires frequently updated data. In order to achieve this, the app uses real time GPS data by simulating the movement pattern of its online users as well as the previous movement patterns of its offline users. This simulation process will find out the less congested and safer routes for faster traversal. Users can use these path suggestions to safely drive themselves out of the disaster stricken area. In case of a user being offline, this app will use data stored on the device to suggest evacuation routes based on human mobility pattern. The implementation of this idea will help the app users evacuate safely and quickly, thus minimizing human casualty due to disaster fatality.",

To minimize under-reporting, an one-stop online reporting system is yet to be developed for general people of third world countries where people can report any types of problems in an anonymous manner. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a generic online reporting system where one can submit report anonymously, even without registration. We propagate the reports to the respective authorities such as law enforcement agencies, anti-corruption commission, city-corporation, policy makers, human rights commissions, etc., after reviewing process. We also publish the reports in our site without disclosing the registered reporters' identities to collect the public opinions about the reports.",

        "abstract": "Homelessness is a large problem in the United States. One of the best solutions for this large population of unsheltered individuals lies in affordable housing, as it allows for individuals to gain substantial footing on a life free from poverty in a safe environment. However, affordable housing complexes are not only very scarce, but also the organizations that own them do not communicate frequently. Because of this, application windows are scattered and the housing applications are extremely fragmented, with each application containing different questions. Our team has designed a mobile solution in collaboration with Catholic Charities to simplify the process of finding and applying to affordable housing in Santa Clara County. The Android application allows users to find affordable housing and apply to any number of housing complexes with one unified application that merges questions from individual applications. However, to be truly effective in streamlining the affordable housing application process, a coalition must be established between all affordable housing organizations in the Santa Clara County Continuum of Care. By doing so, the application can expand to informing tenants of available applicants and more effectively informing users of when housing units are available.",

        "abstract": "Traditional compression algorithms appear to be largely unsuccessful with regards to short strings. In developing countries without connectivity to the web and data infrastructure, SMS remains one of the few ways of handling text-based information. With SMS service providers typically charging for SMS messages on a per-message basis, there exists a need to provide some form of short string compression, specifically with regards to highly structured data. This paper seeks to answer whether or not dictionary structures produce better results of compression than traditional algorithms with respect to highly structured data. To determine whether or not this approach would work, we developed a configurable parser that, when properly configured, accepts the various forms of structured data as provided by the client. We then compare the results to traditional compression mechanisms and measure the success.",

The goal of this research topic is to develop efficient translation system for any language by improving the previous researches on language translation and related topics. Although, a number of researches are done in different areas such as Bangla keyboard layout design, English to Bangla translator etc., very few researches are done to translate Bangla text to English. To develop an efficient translation system is very important. However, it is really expensive as it requires a huge amount of time and resources. In all languages there are many words that may have multiple meanings and also some sentence may have multiple grammar structures to express the same meaning. Therefore, it is a great challenge to do the right semantic analysis. However it is very important to have a translation system which can compute various possible outputs in reasonable time and space.",

However little is known of the ICT's impact on communities, users’ knowledge practices, or its wider effects, e.g. on pedagogy. Prior to establishing communications with end users, this study takes a preparatory step of consulting with mediators in the field. These interviewees are familiar with eGranary’s technology and their users’ contexts, expectations and needs.  The ultimate aim is to incorporate user opinions into eGranary re-designs.

In this research we engaged with unemployed or underemployed individuals at two different NGO sites in Cape Town. We engage, primarily with current and former students of two job readiness programmes and supplement our work with input from intermediary trainers. We outline our use of co-design under the umbrella of Participatory Design and discuss our findings, in resonance with the different documentations of benefits of intermediaries.  Our findings highlight the benefits of working with intermediaries from the NGOs and the benefit of working with NGOs themselves as embedded community partners. Additionally we show that co-design can be used to successfully uncover issues around a problem such as unemployment.",

        "abstract": "Recent rise in aged population and chronic diseases, is placing increasing pressure on health care expenditure. Ubiquitous health care is regarded as a potential driver in reducing such health expenditure. Advancement in wireless communication and sensor technologies permit the real-time acquisition, transmission and processing of critical medical information for ubiquitous health-care applications. Hence, medical body area networks (MBANs) emerge as key technology to facilitate ubiquitous health-care services. However, energy restriction of micro-battery of a sensor device holds back the development of MBANs and also makes MBANs vulnerable to different malicious attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new attack entitled Power Attack exploiting the\r\npower constraint of sensor devices. Power attack forces a sensor to die off due to lack of power supply. Besides, we also propose counter measure for power attack. Finally, we exhibit efficacy of our proposed counter measure using empirical simulation.",

        "abstract": "This article aims to address two critical research questions: how a social enterprise identifies the local actors for the diffusion of its service and what is the role of these actors to widely spread the solutions? The article highlights the emergence of urban\r\ncustomers willing to use alternative electricity supplies developed by a small yet visionary company in the context of discontinuous public electricity supply in Bangalore, India. The case of SELCO helps us to illustrate this market evolution of solar photovoltaic systems. We observe a built-in corporate entrepreneurship culture\r\nof the organization playing an important role in bridging projects into a new context by creating an interactive relationship with local actors (clients). A small number of individuals in the organization starts working to understand the needs of the client,\r\nand slowly identifies new meanings of its service in an urban context recently explored as a market. The research identifies how these off-grid services developed by SELCO initially designed for very poor rural customers are slowly reaching the urban uppermiddle class customers attracted by its practical use and financial incentive. This demonstrated development of a niche market constitutes an early signal of the emergence of a social group willing to change its consumption behavior and contribute to the environment through their day-to-day activity.",

        "abstract": "This work in progress explores a database designed to enable data sharing on custom hardware data collection devices and prototypes. We target the Arduino hardware abstraction layer because of its ease of use and community support and low cost compared to using off the shelf devices. Additionally, other projects and systems frequently are based on the Arduino or Wiring framework such as ODK’s FoneAstra, the Open Energy Monitor, and the Grove system of sensors. However, such open source hardware currently does not have a framework that enables ease of integration into larger data collection systems and sharing of sensor data from local to remote storage. To address the issue, we propose a solution based on a small database usable on the Arduino platform for handling a large number of sensors that would integrate into the Mezuri data collection system. The database is designed to be fit within the memory constraints on a microcontroller while sensor data with relatively few fields per reading. This framework enables users in emerging regions to directly measure physical quantities as well as indirectly measure human behavior in future development projects involving direct sensing. The database can be used by a non-expert. In particular, we investigate the qualities that a technically inclined social scientist would look for when storing such data on microcontrollers. To enable Mezuri integration we support metadata as a first class object accessible with additional utility functions and native synchronization support.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a simple web based mobile money sandbox called DEV-Pesa. The purpose of DEV-Pesa is to enable academic groups to explore issues of privacy, security, and usability within the rapidly growing space of Digital Financial Services for Development and especially mobile money services. Although financial services are an important sector within the broader field of mobile for development, innovating and understanding core concepts within theses services is difficult because the ecosystem is complex and dominated by a few mobile operators.  Most large scale mobile financial services rely on either SIM Toolkit or USSD based user interfaces with an assortment of smaller scale services introducing Android based mobile money applications.  DEV-Pesa aims to create a simplified testbed so that smaller projects can quickly prototype ideas without involving large mobile operators.  Currently the major components of DEV-Pesa are a web interface, transaction API, and a USSD implementation.",

        "abstract": "Localization in disaster affected setting is a challenging problem. This is due to the nature of the environment and a large of unknowns. WiFi indoor localization is a common approach. However, existing literature is yet to address the problem of indoor localization in disaster setting. We propose AWZone, an ad hoc WiFi zonification technique. Using real experiments, our study reveals that AWZone can identify the zone accurately in most cases, eliminating incorrect zones from a set of possible results.",
