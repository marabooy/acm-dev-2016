            <h2>Paper Submission</h2>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <div> Papers should describe original and previously unpublished research. Three metrics will be applied to
                judge the submissions:
                <ol class="alpha">
                    <li> Relevance of the problem for development;</li>
                    <li> Novelty of the ideas;</li>
                    <li> Evaluation of the solution, making a case for development-focused impact. All DEV paper
                        submissions
                        should either provide or directly motivate a novel technical solution that has direct
                        implications
                        for
                        development.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            </div>
            <p> Papers must not exceed 10 pages.
                All Submissions must be in ACM format, submitted as a pdf. The template for submissions can be found
                <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p> Submissions should be fully anonymized. In particular, the names or affiliations of authors should not
                be included so as to allow for blind review. Papers should be submitted via the submission site. As part
                of the submission process, please indicate one or more tracks for which your submission is best suited.
            </p>
